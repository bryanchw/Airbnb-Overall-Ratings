# Airbnb-Overall-Ratings
To get started, datasets are available from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. Required Python libraries are mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

The goal of this project is to help Airbnb hosts to understand which category score contributes the most to the overall rating using linear regression.
